# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples.
# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# Diff: Lists are mutable, tuples aren't. Lists literals use [], tuples literals use ()
# Sim: They are both sequence collections. Both can be created using constructors.
# Both are non-primitive classes. Both are heterogenous: do not need 1 type of data.
# Both are indexable. Both are ordered.
